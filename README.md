# House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning regression models. The dataset includes features such as Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Floors, YearBuilt, Location, Condition, Garage, and Price. Initially, the data was categorized into numerical and categorical features, followed by visualization using bar charts for categorical columns and subplots with boxplots for numerical columns, revealing no outliers. Encoding techniques were applied, with one-hot encoding for Location and label encoding for Condition and Garage. The dataset was then split into independent and dependent variables for model training.

Several regression models were explored to identify the best fit. Linear Regression was unsuitable due to high multicollinearity, while Polynomial Regression was discarded due to a negative R² score. Regularization techniques like Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net Regression also performed poorly due to low R² scores. KNN Regressor and SVR Regressor failed to yield satisfactory results. However, the Decision Tree Regressor performed exceptionally well, and the Random Forest Regressor delivered slightly better results, making it the most suitable model for house price prediction.

This project demonstrates the significance of selecting the right regression model for accurate price predictions. The Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressors proved to be the most effective models. The complete implementation, including preprocessing and model evaluation, is available in this repository. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome!
